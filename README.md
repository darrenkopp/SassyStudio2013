# SassyStudio 2013

SassyStudio 2013 extends the SCSS functionality found in Visual Studio 2013.
Looking for Visual Studio 2012 support? Checkout out the [original SassyStudio](https://github.com/darrenkopp/SassyStudio)

So far what's supported:
- Compilation (libsass/compass/sass compilers are all supported)

Upcoming:
- Smarter compilation (understand imports)
- Sass 3.3 support
- Intellisense Enhancements (custom functions, etc)
- Feature parity overall with original SassyStudio
